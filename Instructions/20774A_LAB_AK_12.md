## Lab: Using machine learning with HDInsight

### Exercise 1: Provision an HDInsight cluster

#### Task 1: Provision an HDInsight cluster

01. On the **20774A-LON-DEV** virtual machine, ensure that you are logged in as **ADATUM\\AdatumAdmin**.
02. On the Start menu, start to type **Internet Explorer**, and then click **Internet Explorer**.
03. In the address bar, type **http://azure.microsoft.com**, click **Portal**, and then sign in using the Microsoft account that is associated with your Azure Learning Pass subscription.
04. In the Azure Portal, click **All Resources**, and then verify that there are no existing HDInsight clusters in your subscription.
05. In the Azure Portal, in the left pane, click **+New**.
06. Click **Analytics**, and then click **HDInsight**.
07. On the **New HDInsight Cluster** blade, type the following details, and then click **Cluster type**:
  - Cluster name: &lt;your name&gt;&lt;date&gt;
08. Enter the following details, and then click **Select**:
 - Cluster type: **Hadoop**
 - Operating system: **Linux**
 - Version: (**Leave at default**)
09. Enter the following details, and then click **Next**:
 - Cluster login username: **hadmin**
 - Cluster login password: **Pa55w.rdPa55w.rd**
 - SSH username: **sadmin**
 - Resource group (create new): **hadooprg**
 - Location: **Select your region**
10. On the **Storage** blade, under **Select a Storage account**, click **Create new**.
11. In the **Create a new Storage account** box, type &lt;***your name***&gt;&lt;***date***&gt;.
12. In the **Default container** box, replace the suggested name with the name of your cluster (for example, &lt;***your name***&gt;&lt;***date***&gt;.
13. Leave all other settings at their defaults, and then click **Next**.
14. On the **Cluster summary** blade, next to **Cluster size**, click **Edit**.
15. On the **Cluster size** blade, in the **Number of Worker nodes** box, type **1**.
16. Click **Worker node size**.

18. Click **Head node size**.
19. On the **Choose your node size** blade, click **View all**, click **A3 General Purpose**, and then click **Select**.
20. On the **Cluster size** blade, click **Next**.
21. On the **Advanced settings** blade, click **Next**.
22. On the **Cluster summary** blade, note the estimated cost per hour of this cluster; to avoid using up your Azure Pass allowance, it is important that you remove the cluster when you are not using it.
23. On the **Cluster summary** blade, click **Create**.
24. The deployment might take 20–30 minutes to complete. Wait for the cluster to be provisioned and do not continue with this exercise until the status shows as **Running**.

#### Task 2: View the cluster configuration in the Azure Portal

02. On the **HDInsight Cluster** blade, view the summary information for your cluster.
03. On the **HDInsight Cluster** blade, click **Scale Cluster**, and note that you can dynamically scale the number of worker nodes to meet processing demand.
04. On the **HDInsight Cluster** blade, click **Overview**, and then in the **Properties** pane, click **Dashboard**.
05. In the **Authentication Required** dialog box, log in as **hadmin** with a password of **Pa55w.rdPa55w.rd**.
06. Note the various metrics provided by the Ambari web application.
07. Close the Ambari tab.

#### Task 3: Connect to the HDInsight cluster using SSH

1.  In the Azure Portal, in the **Properties** pane for the **HDInsight Cluster** blade for your HDInsight cluster, click **Secure Shell (SSH)**.
2. On the **Secure Shell** blade, under **Windows users**, copy the host name **&lt;*your name*&gt;&lt;*date*&gt;-ssh.azurehdinsight.net** to the clipboard.
3. Open a Windows command prompt.
4. In the Command Prompt window, type the following command, and then press Enter:

6. Under **Connection type**, select **SSH**, and then click **Open**.
7. If a security warning that the host certificate cannot be verified is displayed, click **Yes** to continue.
8. When you are prompted, enter **sadmin** and **Pa55w.rdPa55w.rd** as the credentials.

#### Task 4: Browse cluster storage

> Note: The commands in this task are case-sensitive. They can be copied from **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab12\\Ex1Task4Cmds.txt** and pasted by right-clicking the SSH console window.

1.  In the SSH console window, type the following command to view the contents of the root folder in the HDFS file system:
```
hdfs dfs -ls /
```
2. Type the following command to view the contents of the /example folder in the HDFS file system. This folder contains subfolders for sample apps, data, and JAR components:
```
hdfs dfs -ls /example
```
3. Type the following command to view the contents of the /example/data/gutenberg folder, which contains sample text files:
```
hdfs dfs -ls /example/data/gutenberg
```
4. Type the following command on one line to view the text in the ulysses.txt file:
```
hdfs dfs -text /example/data/gutenberg/ulysses.txt
```
5. Note that the file contains large volumes of unstructured text.

>**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have provisioned an HDInsight cluster.

### Exercise 2: Use HDInsight for MapReduce and Spark jobs

#### Task 1: Run the MapReduce word count job

> Note: The commands in this task are case-sensitive. They can be copied from **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab12\\Ex2Task1Cmds.txt** and pasted by right-clicking the SSH console window.

```
hadoop jar /usr/hdp/current/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar wordcount /example/data/gutenberg/davinci.txt /example/results
```
08. Note that this command runs a MapReduce job to process a text file (**davinci.txt**) and store the results in the **/example/results** folder.
09. When the MapReduce job has completed, type the following command, and then press Enter:
```
hdfs dfs -ls /example/results
```
10. Note that a file named **part-r-00000** has been created in the **results** folder.
11. Type the following command, and then press Enter:
